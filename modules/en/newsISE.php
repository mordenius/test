	  <h2>About ISE 2015</h2>
	  <div>
		<p>4 thematic zones were presented on ISE 2015. The main interest and attention for KVINTO company made solutions of Digital Signage. As we were participant of action, could understand more deeply the European tendencies and problems of this year in use of these technologies. DS players sated the market with decisions which carry out advertizing functions, created full-fledged information DS of decision and that the most interesting, complete communication DS of decision are already looked through. But leaves that the market receives the incomplete product demanding adaptation. The majority of companies need that end user would communicate directly with business, and it is reached by adapted "smart"- content. Once you notice – adapted, under client and under the end user. Unfortunately in the European market there is no such concept - norm of formation of the contents.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div>
		<p>Having shown the services in creation, adaptation and service of the content contents for decisions DS, KVINTO received considerable demand, both from clients, and from integrators, software producers and even large vendors. Video and wall decisions which quality of images, exceeds all expectations became the main and the most fascinating the directions this year, and brightness of picture forces to hold long on itself. The second direction can be considered audiovisual art - 3D mepping. And in summary, for us it isn't simple ISE an exhibition, it is the biggest and probably the most interesting forum existing in Europe which specifics open the new horizons and inspires for productive work. Annually action increases number of participants and visitors, and, above all didn't become an exception in 2015, also taking into account subject of AV technologies turned into full fascinating show.</p>
